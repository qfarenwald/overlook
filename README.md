# Overlook

Overlook is a hotel management tool for hotel staff to manage activities like tracking default hotel statistics, customer details, booking information for different types of rooms, with the ability to accept new customers and make new bookings.

In this project I used the following technologies:

- webpack
- SASS
- ES6 (JavaScript)
- HTML
- TDD with chai spies/ mocha
